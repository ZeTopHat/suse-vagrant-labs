# This is the custom.json template for the SUSE Vagrant Labs Project

# The purpose of this file is to provide variables specifically to the "deployer" of this project. It allows for defaults, but also quick tweaks to suit their environment.

# A Vagrantfile and custom.json could be in any directory so long as this variable properly points to the root location of the project.
# This variable tells the Vagrantfile where the root of this project is located.
wheredir: "../"
# This indicates what kind of deployment the machine will be using. Most commonly, "fulldeploy" or "training" would be set. However, possibilities for more modular usage are there. 
# e.g. In HA, "drbd" or "fulldeploy drbd" could be used.
deployment: "fulldeploy"
# This variable enables extra machines from the lab's Vagrantfile, if any. (e.g. RHEL8 or OEL8 machines)
extra: false
# This provides the default values for any libvirt machine deployed by a Vagrantfile that isn't explicitly defined otherwise in its own section of the Vagrantfile.

  # This points to the hypervisor as a nameserver. (Currently used for the destroy trigger to make sure SUSEConnect -d will work.)

  # These point to the primary and secondary subnets used by various Vagrantfiles. the machine specific yaml files hold their respective final octets.
