# This is the custom.json template for the SUSE Vagrant Labs Project

# The purpose of this file is to provide variables specifically to the "deployer" of this project. It allows for defaults, but also quick tweaks to suit their environment.

# A Vagrantfile and custom.json could be in any directory so long as this variable properly points to the root location of the project.
# This variable tells the Vagrantfile where the root of this project is located.
wheredir: "../"
# This provides the default values for any libvirt machine deployed by a Vagrantfile that isn't explicitly defined otherwise in its own section of the Vagrantfile.
libvirt:
  cpus: 1
  memory: 2048
  machine_virtual_size: 42
# This points to the hypervisor as a nameserver. (Currently used for the destroy trigger to make sure SUSEConnect -d will work.) 
nameserver: "192.168.0.1"
# This indicates what kind of deployment the machine will be using. Most commonly, "fulldeploy" or "training" would be set. However, possibilities for more modular usage are there. 
# e.g. In HA, "drbd" or "fulldeploy drbd" could be used.
deployment: "fulldeploy"
# this gives the name of the hypervisor bridge device.
